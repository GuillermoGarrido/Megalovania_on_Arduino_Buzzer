# Megalovania_on_Arduino_Buzzer

**What is this?** This Arduino project plays the popular Undertale song "Megalovania" on a piezo buzzer if a push button is pressed. The code makes use of the tone() function to organize the song by note frequencies and durations for each note. 

**Why would you bother doing this?** I thought of this idea at 3:00am. I like the song and I hadn't done much programming on a buzzer, so I figured I _had_ to make it work. It's not like there was much to do in the middle of the COVID-19 quarantine anyway.
